### My blog
My name is Ana, and I am a cloud engineer with a passion for technology. I have several years of experience working with cloud computing platforms such as Azure, Infrastructure as Code, and Observability tools and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others.

I'll be writing about a wide range of topics related to cloud computing, infrastructure as code, observability, how-tos and lessons learned in my journey and technology in general, including best practices, tips or optimizing cloud costs.

I'll also be sharing my personal experiences and lessons learned in the software industry, and technical books I'm reading or any other topics that I find interesting.

Whether you're a developer, an IT professional, or just someone who is curious about the tech, I hope you'll find something of interest here. If you have any questions, or feedback or just want to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me. 

Thanks for visiting!
