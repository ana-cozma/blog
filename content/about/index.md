### The blog
My name is Ana, and I am a cloud engineer with a passion for technology. I have several years of experience working with cloud computing platforms such as Azure, Infrastructure as Code, and Observability tools and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others.

In the **_Tech_** section: you'll find me writing about a wide range of topics related to cloud computing, infrastructure as code, observability, how-tos and lessons learned in my journey and technology in general, including best practices, tips or optimizing cloud costs.

In the **_Coffee Reads_** section: you'll find quick easy reads over a cup of coffee on my personal experiences, lessons learned in the software industry, and technical books I'm reading or any other topics that I find interesting.

In the **_Tags_** section: you'll be able to filter the articles based on a specific topic you're interested in.

Whether you're a developer, an IT professional, or just someone who is curious about the tech, I hope you'll find something of interest here. If you have any questions, or feedback or just want to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me.
