My name is Ana, and I am a cloud engineer with a passion for technology. I have several years of experience working with cloud computing platforms such as Azure, Infrastructure as Code, Observability tools and I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experience with others.

I'll be writing about a wide range of topics related to cloud computing, infrastructure as code, observability, how-to's and lessons learned in my journey and technology in general, including best practices, tips, optimizing cloud costs, and updates on the latest features and services from the major cloud providers or just trends in general. 

I'll also be sharing my thoughts on emerging trends in the industry and discussing the challenges and opportunities that come with working in the cloud, as well as my personal experiences and lessons learned in the software industry, any technical books I'm reading or any other topics that I find interesting. Most of these will have with the "Tea" tag.

I hope that my blog will be a valuable resource for anyone interested in cloud and technology. Whether you're a developer, an IT professional, or just someone who is curious about the tech, I hope you'll find something of interest here. If you have any questions, feedback or just want to get in touch, please feel free to reach out to me. 

Thanks for visiting!
