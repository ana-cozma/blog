But what would be a good way to handle this?
In this post we will cover Terraform and Helm for managing Kubernetes clusters with some code snippets and an idea on how you can use them together to get you started.</description></item><item><title>Terraform - Handling the deletion of a non-empty AWS S3 Bucket</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-deletion-of-non-empty-s3-bucket/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 12:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-deletion-of-non-empty-s3-bucket/</guid><description>This article applies to Terraform v1.1.4
When using Terraform to manage your infrastructure you will end up in the situation when you want to remove some resources.
You can do this in several ways, but most of the time you can also just remove the Terraform configuration by commenting it out the code, or removing the calling of the module, run terraform apply and it will get rid of the resources.</description></item><item><title>K8s - How to restart Kubernetes Pods</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-how-to-restart-pods/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 12:35:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-how-to-restart-pods/</guid><description>This article applies for Kubernetes v1.15 and above.
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. But what if something happens to the container? In this case, you might need a quick and easy way to restart it.
Kubernetes Pods usually run until there is a new deployment that will replace them.</description></item></channel></rss>
