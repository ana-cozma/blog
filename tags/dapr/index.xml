Whether your communication pattern is service to service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and secured microservices. Essentially, it provides a new way to build microservices by using the reusable blocks implemented as sidecars.
While Dapr is great as it is language agnostic and it solves some challenges that come with microservices and distributed systems, such as message broker integration, encryption etc, troubleshooting Dapr issues can be quite challenging.</description></item></channel></rss>
