Because of our infrastructure setup, I wanted to have all the rules from OWASP 3.2 enabled, but I needed to be able to exclude some of our (valid) requests from being blocked as well. To achieve this, I could either try to configure the WAF Config section on our Gateway or create a WAF policy.
Given that it was not entirely clear how you can use proper exclusions and filters based on what you need, I decided to write this post to explain the differences I found between the two and how you can use them.</description></item></channel></rss>
