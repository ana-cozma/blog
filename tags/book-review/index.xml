I want to start with a disclaimer on this one. I have not worked as a software architect. So this book review will be from the perspective of someone that has worked as a DevOps engineer (more of a Cloud Engineer if we have to label it), and that has been involved in the design of systems and the architecture of systems.</description></item><item><title>Book Review: Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/coffee/book-review-observability/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Jan 2023 11:17:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/coffee/book-review-observability/</guid><description>For the first book review in what I will call my coffee reads section of the blog I will be reviewing the book Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence.
Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence The book, in its own description, sets out to be an advocate for the adoption of observability practices in the software industry. Written by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda from Honeycomb.io, the book aims to be a resource for anyone interested in learning more about what is good observability, how you can build on top of your system today, and how to implement it in your organization.</description></item></channel></rss>
