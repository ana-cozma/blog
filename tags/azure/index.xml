Because of our infrastructure setup, I wanted to have all the rules from OWASP 3.2 enabled, but I needed to be able to exclude some of our (valid) requests from being blocked as well. To achieve this, I could either try to configure the WAF Config section on our Gateway or create a WAF policy.
Given that it was not entirely clear how you can use proper exclusions and filters based on what you need, I decided to write this post to explain the differences I found between the two and how you can use them.</description></item><item><title>Terraform: Add Group Members as Owners to a Service Principal or Az AD Application</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-add-group-members-as-owners/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 11:18:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-add-group-members-as-owners/</guid><description>Currently, there is no option for adding a Group as an Owner to a Service Principal or Azure AD Application.
If you try you will most likely run into the following error:
unexpected status 400 with OData error: Request_BadRequest: The reference target â”‚ &amp;#39;Group_0000000-0000-000000-000000&amp;#39; of type &amp;#39;Group&amp;#39; is invalid for the &amp;#39;owners&amp;#39; reference. This is a quick post on how you can add members of an Az AD Group as Owners of a Service Principal or Azure AD Application.</description></item></channel></rss>
