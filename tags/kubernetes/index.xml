Whether your communication pattern is service to service invocation or pub/sub messaging, Dapr helps you write resilient and secured microservices. Essentially, it provides a new way to build microservices by using the reusable blocks implemented as sidecars.
While Dapr is great as it is language agnostic and it solves some challenges that come with microservices and distributed systems, such as message broker integration, encryption etc, troubleshooting Dapr issues can be quite challenging.</description></item><item><title>Troubleshooting and Resolving a Pod Stuck in 'CreateContainerConfigError' in Kubernetes</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-pod-createcontainerconfigerror/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jan 2023 22:38:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-pod-createcontainerconfigerror/</guid><description>The other day I was making changes to my helm charts and, after deploying my application, I noticed that one of my pods was stuck in a CreateContainerConfigError state. This is a pretty tricky error because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t give you any details on what the underlying issue could be.
What is the CreateContainerConfigError? To understand this, let&amp;rsquo;s look at what happens at deployment time to give you an idea of the flow and what could go wrong at each step.</description></item><item><title>Kube-bench and Popeye: A Power Duo for AKS Security Compliance</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-aks-security-helpers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2023 19:10:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-aks-security-helpers/</guid><description>In today&amp;rsquo;s world, security is a top priority for any organization or at least it should be. With the rise of cloud computing, the number of security threats has increased exponentially.
So how do we keep up? Where do we start?
Microsoft has created a set of security benchmarks to give users a starting point for setting up their security configurations. The Microsoft cloud security benchmark (MCSB) is the successor of Azure Security Benchmark (ASB), which was rebranded in October 2022 (Currently in public preview).</description></item><item><title>Terraform vs Helm for Managing K8s Objects</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-vs-helm-for-managing-k8s-objects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 19:34:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-vs-helm-for-managing-k8s-objects/</guid><description>When I started migrating to Kubernetes (K8s) I discovered that I can use Terraform for managing not only the infrastructure, but also I could define the K8s objects in it, but I also could use Helm to handle that. But what would be a good way to handle this?
In this post we will cover Terraform and Helm for managing Kubernetes clusters with some code snippets and an idea on how you can use them together to get you started.</description></item><item><title>K8s: Fix Helm release failing with an upgrade still in progress</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-fix-helm-release-failing-with-an-upgrade/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2022 17:49:48 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-fix-helm-release-failing-with-an-upgrade/</guid><description>This article applies to: Helm v3.8.0
Helm helps you manage Kubernetes applications â€” Helm Charts help you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes application. More details on Helm and the commands can be found in the official documentation.
Assuming you use Helm to handle your releases, you might end up in a case where the release will be stuck in a pending state and all subsequent releases will keep failing.</description></item><item><title>K8s: How to restart Kubernetes Pods</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-how-to-restart-pods/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 12:35:04 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/k8s-how-to-restart-pods/</guid><description>This article applies for Kubernetes v1.15 and above.
Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery. But what if something happens to the container? In this case, you might need a quick and easy way to restart it.
Kubernetes Pods usually run until there is a new deployment that will replace them.</description></item><item><title>KongPlugin CORS: fixing Access-Control-Allow-Origin header missing error</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/kong-pluging-cors-policy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Dec 2021 17:55:37 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/kong-pluging-cors-policy/</guid><description>In our current environment we have Kong as our Ingress controller in front of our applications.
We are also using the Kong CORS Plugin to enable browsers to make cross-origin requests to our application&amp;rsquo;s backend. The CORS plugin lets you configure the API gateway behavior to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If you want to dig deeper into what CORS is, please check the CORS glossary link.
We also make use of helm charts to handle our deployment.</description></item></channel></rss>
