We are also using the Kong CORS Plugin to enable browsers to make cross-origin requests to our application&amp;rsquo;s backend. The CORS plugin lets you configure the API gateway behavior to support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). If you want to dig deeper into what CORS is, please check the CORS glossary link.
We also make use of helm charts to handle our deployment.</description></item></channel></rss>
