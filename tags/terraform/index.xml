Because of our infrastructure setup, I wanted to have all the rules from OWASP 3.2 enabled, but I needed to be able to exclude some of our (valid) requests from being blocked as well. To achieve this, I could either try to configure the WAF Config section on our Gateway or create a WAF policy.
Given that it was not entirely clear how you can use proper exclusions and filters based on what you need, I decided to write this post to explain the differences I found between the two and how you can use them.</description></item><item><title>Terraform: Add Group Members as Owners to a Service Principal or Az AD Application</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-add-group-members-as-owners/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Apr 2023 11:18:28 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-add-group-members-as-owners/</guid><description>Currently, there is no option for adding a Group as an Owner to a Service Principal or Azure AD Application.
If you try you will most likely run into the following error:
unexpected status 400 with OData error: Request_BadRequest: The reference target â”‚ &amp;#39;Group_0000000-0000-000000-000000&amp;#39; of type &amp;#39;Group&amp;#39; is invalid for the &amp;#39;owners&amp;#39; reference. This is a quick post on how you can add members of an Az AD Group as Owners of a Service Principal or Azure AD Application.</description></item><item><title>Terraform vs Helm for Managing K8s Objects</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-vs-helm-for-managing-k8s-objects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Aug 2022 19:34:20 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-vs-helm-for-managing-k8s-objects/</guid><description>When I started migrating to Kubernetes (K8s) I discovered that I can use Terraform for managing not only the infrastructure, but also I could define the K8s objects in it, but I also could use Helm to handle that. But what would be a good way to handle this?
In this post we will cover Terraform and Helm for managing Kubernetes clusters with some code snippets and an idea on how you can use them together to get you started.</description></item><item><title>Terraform: Alternative to the Template provider on Apple M1 MBP</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-alternative-to-deprecated-template-prov/</link><pubDate>Fri, 05 Aug 2022 17:52:07 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-alternative-to-deprecated-template-prov/</guid><description>We ran into an issue while applying our Terraform infrastructure on a M1 Mac where we were making use of the Terraform Provider Template.
When applying it, we were getting the following error:
template v2.2.0 does not have a package available for your current platform, darwin_arm64 Since the provider is archived, we need to find an alternative.
What does archiving mean? Per Terraform Archiving Providers documentation.
The code repository and all commit, issue, and PR history will still be available.</description></item><item><title>Terraform: Handling the deletion of a non-empty AWS S3 Bucket</title><link>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-deletion-of-non-empty-s3-bucket/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 May 2022 12:39:03 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://ana-cozma.github.io/blog/posts/terraform-deletion-of-non-empty-s3-bucket/</guid><description>This article applies to Terraform v1.1.4
When using Terraform to manage your infrastructure you will end up in the situation when you want to remove some resources.
You can do this in several ways, but most of the time you can also just remove the Terraform configuration by commenting it out the code, or removing the calling of the module, run terraform apply and it will get rid of the resources.</description></item></channel></rss>
