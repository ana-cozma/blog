Observability Engineering: Achieving Production Excellence The book, in its own description, sets out to be an advocate for the adoption of observability practices in the software industry. Written by Charity Majors, Liz Fong-Jones, and George Miranda from Honeycomb.io, the book aims to be a resource for anyone interested in learning more about what is good observability, how you can build on top of your system today, and how to implement it in your organization.</description></item></channel></rss>
